# What is DataTypes?
DataType describe what type of value(data) is stored inside the variable.

## Data types can be divided into two
* Primitive Data Type
* Non-Primitive Data Type

# Primitive Data Types:

Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types.

Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it

Primitive data types are compared by its values.

```js
let str1 = "Hello";
console.log(str1);
str1[0] = "Y";
console.log(str1);  // Str1 value is not changed Hello is Output

let num1 = 1;
let num2 = 1;

console.log(num1 == num2); // true

let str2 = "Yellow";
console.log(str1 == str2); //false
```

Primitive data types in JavaScript:

 1. Number - Integers, floats
 2. String - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
 3. Boolean - true or false value
 4. Null - empty value or no value
 5. Undefined - a declared variable without a value
 6. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor
 7. BigInt

# Number
* Number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

* Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

* Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.
```js
let age = 35
const gravity = 9.81  // we use const for non-changing values, gravitational constant in  m/s2
let mass = 72         // mass in Kilogram
const PI = 3.14       // pi a geometrical constant

console.log(age, gravity, mass, PI)

console.log(1/0) // infinity
console.log("string"/ 2) // NaN --> non a number


console.log("naveen" / 2); // NaN
console.log(1/0); // infinity
console.log(NaN + 1);  // NaN
console.log(1 + NaN); // NaN
console.log(NaN ** 0); // 1
```


## String: 

* Strings are used to represent textual data, such as a sequence of characters.

    * Single quotes: 'Hello'
    * Double quotes: "Hello"
    * Backticks: `Hello`

```js
// string

let space = ' ' // an empty space string
let language = 'JavaScript'

console.log(space)
console.log("language = ", language); // JavaScript
console.log("type of language = ", typeof (language));  // String

const str1 = "learn Javascript";
const str2 = 'Love Javascript';
console.log(`Print str1 ${str1} and str2 ${str2}`);

```
* Single quotes and double quotes are practically the same and you can use either of them.

* Backticks are generally used when you need to include variables or expressions into a string. This is done by wrapping variables or expressions with ${variable or expression} as shown above.

* If we try to modify the string stored in variable *str*, JavaScript should raise an error.

```js
language[0] = 'L'

```
* This expression does not change the string stored in the variable *str*. So, we can say that strings are not modifiable or in other words immutable.

* Primitive data types are compared by its values.

```js
let numOne = 3
let numTwo = 3

console.log(numOne == numTwo)      // true

let js = 'JavaScript'
let py = 'Python'

console.log(js == py)             //false 

let lightOn = true
let lightOff = false

console.log(lightOn == lightOff) // false
```

# Boolean: 

* It is used to represent a boolean value, which can be either true or false.

```js
const isEligible = true;
console.log(isEligible)
```

# undefined
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
```js
let name;
console.log(name);
console.log(typeof(name)) // undefined
```

# Null
* The null data type mean empty value
```js
const age = null;
console.log(age);
console.log(typeof(age)) // object
```

# Symbol: 

* Symbol in JavaScript are used to represent a unique and immutable value.
```js
const firstName = symbol('naveen');
const lastName = symbol('rapelli');
console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName)
 ```

## BigInt: 

* BigInt is a new numeric data type that can represent integers with arbitrary precision.
```js
const bigNum = 1234455566671n;
console.log(bigNum);

```

# Non-primitive data types

* Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it gets created.

## example:
```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[0] = 10

console.log(nums)  // [10, 2, 3]
```
* Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value.

* Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(nums == numbers)  // false
```
* we do not compare non-primitive data types
* Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = nums

console.log(nums == numbers)  // true
```
Non-Primitive data types
1. An object
2. An array

# Array

* An array is a list of data values in a square bracket.
* Arrays can contain the same or different data types.
* Array values are referenced by their index.
* the array index starts at zero. the second element at index one, and the third element at index two, etc.

```js
// creating array.
  let nums = [1, 2, 3]
// changing array value 1 to 10 --> index 0 is 1
  nums[0] = 10
//Outout
 console.log(nums)  // [10, 2, 3]
```
* As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. 
* Non-primitive data types cannot be compared by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(nums == numbers)  // false

let userOne = {
name:'ramu',
role:'loves',
country:'India'
}

let userTwo = {
name:'ramu',
role:'loves',
country:'India'
}

console.log(userOne == userTwo) // false
```
* we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects.
* Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of value. 
* Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
let numbers = nums

console.log(nums == numbers)  // true

let userOne = {
name:'ramu',
role:'loves',
country:'India'
}

let userTwo = userOne

console.log(userOne == userTwo)  // true
```

## Object: 

* Collection of value in the form of key-value pairs which can include properties and methods.
```js
let user = {
    name: "learn",
    lastname: "javascript",
    isDeveloper: true,
    age: 20
}
console.log(user);
console.log(typeof user);
```

# Array:
* Array represents an ordered collection of values, which can be of any data type.

```js
let courses = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'];
console.log(courses);
```

# Function: 
* Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called by other parts of the program.

```js
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello Developer, Good Morning');
}

greet(); // calling function
```

### Exercise: Level 1
1. Declare a variable named learn and assign it to an initial value 'JavaScript'.
2. Print the string on the browser console using console.log().
3. Declare a variable named age and assign it to an initial value 30.
4. Declare a variable named eligible and assign it to an initial value true.
5. Declare a variable named empty and assign it to an initial value empty.
